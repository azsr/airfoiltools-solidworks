# airfoiltools-solidworks
Userscript to convert Selig into Solidworks-compatible CSV on airfoiltools.com.

This overwrites the "Parser" table on airfoiltools, so be careful!

## Steps

* Have Tampermonkey (Chrome), Greasemonkey (Firefox), or your favorite userscript manager installed.
* Create a blank script and copy-and-paste the source file in this in.
* Open up airfoiltools, find your favorite airfoil/aerofoil, and copy the "Solidworks" data into a .txt file.

## Future development
* Button for one-click copying to keyboard or download
